## Requirements

+ Linux
+ Python 3.7
+ torch==1.12.1+cu113
+ torchmetrics==0.11.4
+ dgl==1.0.2+cu113
+ ogb==1.3.5

## Download Preparation

For HGB datasets (ACM, DBLP, Freebase, and IMDB)ï¼š

```shell
sh download_hgb_datasets.sh 
```

For OAG-Venue and OAG-L1-Field, we follow NARS' data prepatation in [https://github.com/facebookresearch/NARS/tree/main/oag_dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NARS/tree/main/oag_dataset).
After generating *.pk and *.npy files, you have to:
- put these files in the directory 
- rename graph_field.pk to graph_L1.pk


For OGBN-MAG, the code will automatically download it via the ogb package.


For OAG-Venue and OAG-L1-Field, we adhere to NARS' data preparation instructions found at [https://github.com/facebookresearch/NARS/tree/main/oag_dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NARS/tree/main/oag_dataset).
After generating *.pk and *.npy files, you should:
- Place these files in the directory `./datasets/nars_academic_oag/`.
- Rename graph_field.pk to graph_L1.pk.
